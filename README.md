# CS 255 Portfolio Submission: System Analysis & Design
Jasmine Garcia - 27 June 2025

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   The DriverPass project was all about creating a system for a fictional driving school that wanted to modernize the way students book lessons, take practice tests, and track their progress. The client needed a system that worked for both the          students and the instructors, and that made the whole experience easier to me - from registration to payment to confirmation. 
   
2. What did you do particularly well?
   I think I did a decent job of breaking down the user's needs and turning that into something that made sense on paper. I felt that my sequence diagram for booking a lesson turned out especially clear and detailed, and I felt confident submitting     it because it did a good job of showing the flow between the student, scheduler, and payment processor. I also made sure the business requirements document stayed organized and easy to follow, which really helped guide the rest of the design.
   
3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   If I had more time, I’d go back and fine-tune the activity diagram. It worked, but I think the decision points could’ve been labeled more clearly to help someone new understand the logic right away. I’d also include more details about what
   happens when things go wrong, like scheduling conflicts, which wasn't included in my original submission. However, it's something I realized I didn't add in there after I submitted it. 
   
4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I tried to put myself in the user’s shoes. For instance, if I were a student using this system, what would I expect? That helped me figure out what features were a "need to have" and not just a "nice to have". Some features, like automatic email     confirmations and making the booking process super simple, came from that mindset. Designing with the user in mind is huge! Even if the system is technically strong, it won’t matter if it’s frustrating or confusing to use.
   
5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   I like to start with the big picture and ask, what does the user actually want to do? From there, I break it down into smaller parts and figure out what the system needs to handle. Diagrams help me a lot early on, and I try to map everything out     before getting too deep into the technical stuff. In the future, I want to get better at getting feedback early and maybe even using mockups or quick prototypes to see if the design actually makes sense before moving forward. Of course, this         course was only 8 weeks, so the time-sensitive nature of the submissions just made it difficult to get it done any earlier.
